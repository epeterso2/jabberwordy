A collection of classes for reading and writing puzzles in the PUZ file format
<p>
PUZ is a file format used by the majority of crossword puzzle constructing and solving applications as well as by most popular editors and publishers.
The format is both compact and binary, a decision that trades ease-of-readability for small size.
The format is not formally documented, but an unofficial reverse-engineered version of the PUZ specification is available
from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/puz/wiki/FileFormat">PUZ project</a> on Google Code.
