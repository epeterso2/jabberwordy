A collection of classes for reading and writing puzzles in the Universal Crossword Puzzle Format (XPF).
<p>
XPF is a file format developed by Jim Horne.
The format is based upon XML and was designed to provide maximum flexibility in representing crossword puzzles.
<a href="http://www.xwordinfo.com/XPF/">The XPF Specification</a> is available on <a href="http://www.xwordinfo.com">XWordInfo</a>.
<p>
A single XPF puzzle is represented by a {@link com.epeterso2.jabberwordy.serialization.xpf.XPFPuzzle} object.
Because an XPF file may contain multiple puzzles, the serializer and deserializer classes work with the
{@link com.epeterso2.jabberwordy.serialization.xpf.XPFPuzzleCollection} class.  
<p>
<ul>
<li>The {@link com.epeterso2.jabberwordy.serialization.xpf.XPFPuzzleOutputStream} is used to convert a byte[] representation of an XPF file
into a {@link com.epeterso2.jabberwordy.serialization.xpf.XPFPuzzleCollection} object.</li>
<li>The {@link com.epeterso2.jabberwordy.serialization.xpf.XPFPuzzleInputStream} is used to convert a
{@link com.epeterso2.jabberwordy.serialization.xpf.XPFPuzzleCollection} object into a byte[] representation of an XPF file.</li>
</ul>
